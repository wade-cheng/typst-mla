# Typst MLA

`mla.typ` is a custom [typst](https://typst.app/) template to format documents in MLA. See example document at `main.pdf`.

https://github.com/wychwitch/typst-mla9-template is more feature-complete. However, because of https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/311, the first paragraph after a heading is not indented. This issue is not fixed as of 17 April, 2024. This template fixes this issue via a hacky workaround, but again, is less feature complete than wychwitch's.
